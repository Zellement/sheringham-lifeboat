		<p>We regret to advise our friends, followers and supporters that until further notice Sheringham Lifeboat Station and both shops will be closed to visitors as will all the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) lifeboat stations, shops, museums and visitor centres. Besides protecting the wellbeing of our volunteers, our staff and our visitors this will enable us to preserve and continue with our lifesaving service. In addition, we will be cancelling all indoor and outdoor RNLI fundraising and other events including visits to schools.   We will keep you informed via our website and social media accounts of any developments and will also provide updates on any lifesaving launches.
Your support for the RNLI is much appreciated and we hope that you will understand why we have made these difficult decisions.</p>
